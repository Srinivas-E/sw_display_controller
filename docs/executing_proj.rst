Executing The Project
---------------------
Once the code and images are flashed

    a. The XTAG2 connector is removed from the provided customer hardware
	Note: This is done because the XTAG2 pulls the reset line and hence the board is unable to reset
    b. The power for the hardware is switched OFF
    c. The hardware is powered up. Now the code runs from the flash
    d. We can see 4 images with multiple transition effects
