Executing The Project
---------------------
Once the code and images are flashed

    a. The XTAG2 connector is removed from the hardware,
	Note: This is done because the XTAG2 pulls the reset line and hence the board is unable to reset,
    b. The hardware is powered down,
    c. The hardware is powered up. Now the code runs from the flash,
    d. We can see 6 images with multiple transition effects on the LCD screen.
