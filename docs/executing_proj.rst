Executing The Project
---------------------
Once the code and images are flashed

    a. Remove the XTAG2 connector from the provided customer hardware
	Note: This is done because the XTAG2 pulls the reset line and hence the board is unable to reset
    b. Switch OFF the power for the hardware
    c. Power the hardware again. Now the code should be running from the flash
    d. The user should be able to see 4 images with multiple transition effects
