Description
-----------

This demonstration uses the L16 core board to create a level-meter kind of spectral display on an LCD for an analog audio input. This application showcases the real-time spectral analysis using the fft libraries and use of XMOS core board and sliceCARDs device to loopback the audio playback and real-time rendering and display of spectrum by taking short-time fourier transform.
